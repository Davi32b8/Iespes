# [**_`Basic Coding`_**](#basic-coding)

Content developed by me to be used by the teacher in the basic programming classes.

## [**HTML & CSS examples:**](#html--css-examples)

Here is the content used in the **first part** of programming classes.
**_Only HTML and CSS_** were used in this part, focusing on learning basic
front-end knowledge.

As practical exercise the students cloned some sites:

- [**_`Simple login page`_**] - First experience with basic HTML
- [**_`Router login page`_**] - Continued HTML basics and introduced basic CSS
- [**_`Speed test page`_**] - Exercised past content (HTML & CSS)
- [**_`Google login page`_**] - Google login page to fix knowledge

## [**Extra examples:**](#extra-examples)

As an extra challenge I made two other sites to be recreated:

- [**_`Spotify Clone`_**] - The simplest Spotify clone using just pure HTML, CSS and
  basic Javascript
- [**_`Spotify Clone (Responsive)`_**] - The same site as before but with basic
  responsiveness
