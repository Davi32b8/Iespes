### Classes: Basic Coding

Content developed by me to be used by the teacher in the basic programming classes.

#### HTML & CSS examples:

Here is the content used in the **first part** of programming classes.
**_Only HTML and CSS_** were used in this part, focusing on learning basic
front-end knowledge.

As practical exercise the students cloned some sites:

| [**_`Simple login page`_**](https://dreisss.github.io/iespes/classes/basic-coding/basic/login-page "First experience with basic HTML")
| [**_`Router login page`_**](https://dreisss.github.io/iespes/classes/basic-coding/basic/router-login "Continued HTML basics and introduced basic CSS")
| [**_`Speed test page`_**](https://dreisss.github.io/iespes/classes/basic-coding/basic/speed-page "Exercised past content (HTML & CSS)")
| [**_`Google login page`_**](https://dreisss.github.io/iespes/classes/basic-coding/basic/google-login "Google login page to fix knowledge") |

#### Extra examples:

As an extra challenge I made two other sites to be recreated:

| [**_`Spotify Clone`_**](https://dreisss.github.io/iespes/classes/basic-coding/extra/spotify "The simplest Spotify clone using just pure HTML, CSS and basic Javascript")
| [**_`Spotify Clone (Responsive)`_**](https://dreisss.github.io/iespes/classes/basic-coding/extra/spotify-responsive "The same site as before but with basic responsiveness") |
