## [**Description**](#description)

This repository is to save and organize some projects and things I've made while
I was a student of the _Computer Networks course_ at [**_Iespes_**]. During this
period, from 2021 to 2023, I worked as a **tutor/assistant professor** and
**computer laboratory monitor** as well.

Other repo with related content is the [**_iespes extra_**] repo.
